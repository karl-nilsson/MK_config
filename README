This configuration drives a standard 4-axis 3D printer using the PRU for
high speed step/dir pulse generation and a CRAMPS driver board.

Current X and Y settings are appropriate for a typical "MendelMax" style
printer, with the following settings:

max vel   = 200 mm/s
max accel = 3000 mm/s/s
scale     = 80 steps/mm

Adjust as required for your machine.  Make scale negative to invert any
axis that is moving 'backwards'.
